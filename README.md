This project aims to predict whether a patient will experience heart failure based on a Kaggle dataset that analyzes health factors and data from electrocardiograms. 
Each file goes through steps of visualizing data and exploring any discrepancies or bias in sampling, followed by preprocessing the data to then create an algorithm 
trained by the cleaned data.
